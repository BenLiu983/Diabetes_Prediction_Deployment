# Diabetes Prediction and Deployment

# 1. Objective

Forecast the probability of diabetes for a given group of patients using 6 Machine Learning classifications models, develop and deploy the web app with HTML, CSS, Flask, and Azure.

# 2. Data

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic
